# Advanced Programming

This repository contains every material of the course of Advanced Programming @ UniTS & SISSA during the academic year 2023/24. More precisely it contains:
- a PDF file of all the lectures provided by the teacher
- all the laboratory exercises (solved)
- my notes of the lectures, including the transcript of the solutions of the laboratories and my answers of simulations' and exams' theoretical questions
- a summary of some theory concepts (called flash cards)
- an incomplete development of the two exam projects I undertook

During the course, three projects have been assigned. My development of them can be found always on my GitHub page, in the repositories `SparseMatrix_bySerafino_Franzese`, `Statistics_NumericalIntegration` and `Statistics_NumericalIntegration_2.0`. The first two were developed together with another collegue, even though I fixed some mistakes of the second one in order to proceed to the development of the third.

The original material provided by the teacher can be found in his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pcafrica/advanced_programming_2023-2024).

If you notice any mistake, you're kindly invited to reach me so that I can correct it.
