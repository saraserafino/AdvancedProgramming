This repository contains every material of the course of Advanced Programming @ UniTS/SISSA during the academic year 2023/24. More precisely it contains:

- all the laboratory exercises (solved)
- my notes of the lectures, including the transcript of the solutions of the laboratories and my answers of simulations' and exams' theoretical questions
- a summary of some theory concepts (called flash cards)
- an incomplete development of the two exam projects I undertook
