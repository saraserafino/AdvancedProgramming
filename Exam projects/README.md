# Exam projects
The first one is [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/pcafrica/advanced_programming_2023-2024/blob/main/exams/2024-01-17/part2.md) and was further developed at home in order to better prepare for the subsequent session (since I refused the grade, not considering it good enough); it lacks of correctness for the Quadratic Optimisation Problem.<br>
The second one is [Thomas Algorithm for heat diffusion problem](https://github.com/pcafrica/advanced_programming_2023-2024/blob/main/exams/2024-02-13/part2.md) and it is perfectly and fully developed (allowing me to reach the highest grade).

## Code organization
For each module there is a folder which separates source files from header files; the main file is in its folder called main; a CMake and a setup.py are provided. Gradient Descent does not have a readme since it was not fully developed, on the contrary Thomas Algorithm for heat diffusion problem has it.

## CMake and libraries
A CMake for the creation of the modules is provided. Also a setup.py is provided, creating a Python package easily installable viaÂ pip.
Some Python packages were used: SciPy, tabulate. They can be installed with `pip install [names] --user`.<br>
SciPy is used for mathematical operations; tabulate to create a table of some results.

## How to compile
A CMake and a setup.py are provided in the main directory. Setup.py implicitly calls CMake, thus everything is ready writing:
```bash
python setup.py install --user
```
Or even better just using pip
```bash
pip install --user .
```
Lastly, to compile the main:
```bash
python main/main.py
```
